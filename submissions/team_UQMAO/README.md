# Example submission

Here the submission format is described.

## Author(s)

- Author 1 (Affiliation(s))
- Author 2 (Affiliation(s))

## Mapped locations

We produced shoreline time-series for the following locations (check locations):

- [x] NARRABEEN
- [ ] DUCK
- [ ] TRUCVERT
- [ ] TORREYPINES

## Algorithm/workflow description

We used the algorithm XX as described in detail in XX et al. (2020). Describe the algorithm in 1-2 lines.
The model is implemented in the XX software package that was used here.

## Workflow to reproduce

Please provide a detailed description of the workflow here, in such a way that the results may be reproduced independently by others.
The preferred way to ensure reproducibility is to provide a commented script and environment settings in the `algorithms` folder.

## Estimation of effort

Please provide an (rough) estimate of the time it took to run the workflow (e.g., download, read in data, process). If possible, please also state the computational resources that were required.
