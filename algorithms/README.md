## Satellite-derived shoreline algorithms

This folder contains all the code used to generate the satellite-derived shoreline time-series at the test sites.

It is OPTIONAL to share your code. If you do, please provide commented code as well as a `README.md` with instructions on how to run the code to reproduce the outputs (installation, inputs etc).

An example for CoastSat is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.
